I'm a graduate student from [Tianjin University](https://www.tju.edu.cn/), currently pursuing my Master's degree in the School of [College of Intelligence AND Computing](https://cic.tju.edu.cn/).

My research interests include large language models, reinforcement learning, and AI system optimization. I am currently an intern at the [Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/), where I work on projects related to reinforcement learing and agent-based systems.
